# Mutiro Setup Script

Automated installer for [Mutiro](https://mutiro.com) + Claude Code integration.

## Quick Start

If you just want to set up Mutiro and connect it to Claude Code in one command, paste this into your terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobmr/mutiro-setup/main/mutiro-setup.sh)"
```

This will install the Mutiro CLI (if needed), guide you through signing up or logging in, create a Claude agent if you don't already have one, generate a `.claude/mcp/config.json` file and a `start-claude` script. After it completes, run:

```bash
./start-claude
```

to start the Mutiro agent daemon and launch Claude. You can also use `mutiro chat` for a terminal chat interface.

## What the script does

- Installs the Mutiro CLI if it isn't already present.
- Prompts you to log in or sign up for a Mutiro account using your email. If you don't have an account, you'll be asked for a username and full name and the script will call `mutiro auth signup` for you.
- Retrieves your API key and agent details via `mutiro whoami`. If no agent exists, you can create one from within the script.
- Writes a `.claude/mcp/config.json` file that wires Mutiro into Claude Desktop via MCP.
- Creates a `start-claude` launcher script that starts the Mutiro agent daemon (`mutiro start`) and then launches Claude.

## Prerequisites

- You have a Mutiro beta invite code and either have installed or will install the Mutiro CLI.
- `curl`, `jq`, and `bash` available.
- Claude Desktop or Claude Code installed for MCP integration.

## Detailed instructions

### 1. Install the Mutiro CLI

If you prefer to install manually, you can run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://mutiro.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Sign up or log in

First‑time users need to sign up with their beta invite code:

```bash
mutiro auth signup your.email@example.com your_username "Your Name"
```

You'll be prompted for your invite code and will receive a one‑time password (OTP) via email. If you already have an account, log in with:

```bash
mutiro auth login your.email@example.com
```

The setup script handles these steps interactively.

### 3. Create a Claude agent

If you haven't created an agent yet, you can do so in your project folder:

```bash
mutiro agents create claude_assistant "Claude Assistant" --engine claude
```

The script will offer to create one for you if it doesn't detect an existing agent.

### 4. Start the Mutiro agent in Claude

Once you have an agent configuration (`.mutiro-agent.yaml`), run:

```bash
mutiro start
```

The `start-claude` script generated by this repo will handle this for you.

### 5. Choose how to connect

- **Terminal chat:** use `mutiro chat` to talk to your Claude agent from a terminal.
- **MCP integration (Claude Desktop):** The `.claude/mcp/config.json` created by the script adds Mutiro as an MCP server with your API key and agent. Restart Claude Desktop after running the script.
- **Mobile apps:** Download the Mutiro mobile app on iOS (via TestFlight) or Android (via Play Store) ([mutiro.com](https://mutiro.com/docs/guides/quickstart#:~:text=the%20MCP%20Integration%20guide,now%20have%20Claude%20connected%20to), [play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mutirolabs.mutiro.mobile#:~:text=About%20this%20app%20%20arrow_forward,com%20Twitter%2FX%3A%20%40mutirolabs)). Log in with the same email and you'll receive an OTP. You can then send and receive messages with your agent on the go.
